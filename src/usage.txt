Usage: elect [-w N|--winners N] BALLOTFILE...

Each BALLOTFILE has one ballot description per line, with candidate
names separated by > or = to indicate strict and equal preference.
Prefixing a ballot with WEIGHT: makes WEIGHT copies of it.

  Chocolate > Vanilla > Strawberry > Cookie Dough
  Cookie Dough > Chocolate > Strawberry
  2: Strawberry = Chocolate > Vanilla

Candidate names are case-sensitive, and may include whitespace but may
not include > or =.  Whitespace around operators is ignored.
Candidates not listed in a ballot will be treated as tied for least
preferred.

Pass - to read ballots from stdin.
